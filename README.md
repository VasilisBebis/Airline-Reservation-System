# Airline Reservation System
C Project for the lesson of C Programming Language for University of Piraeus.

This project is an airline reservation system that can hold up to 20 users. It has a main menu through which the admins of the airline company have access to modify the flight's costs. Also through the main menu the users can create their accounts. After creating an account the user can view or modify their personal information and can also book their 3 available flights by selecting the 3 desired destinations. Then, the total cost of the flights is calculated and the user is prompted to pay for the trips. After that, the user can also view the most expensive out of the flights they have booked.
